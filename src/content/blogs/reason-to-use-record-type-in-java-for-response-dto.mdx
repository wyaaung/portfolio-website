Java continually evolves to provide developers with a better programming experience. The introduction of 'Record' as a preview feature in Java 14 exemplifies this effort.

This post will explore the concept of Java's 'Record' and the reasons for its usage.

# What is a Record?

In Java, a 'Record' is a new type that allows for the concise definition of immutable objects that only contain data.

In traditional Java, defining a data-only class required a lot of boilerplate code, including constructors, getters, equals(), hashCode(), toString(), and various other methods.

Records alleviate this inconvenience by enabling data representation with a more concise syntax.

```java
public record ItemResponseDto (
    @Schema(description = "Item ID", example = "1")
    Long itemId,

    @Schema(description = "User information")
    UserResponseDto user,

    @Schema(description = "Item like count")
    int itemLikeCount
) {
  public ItemResponseDto(User user, Item item) {
    this(
      item.getId(),
      new UserResponseDto(user),
      item.getLikeCount()
    );
  }
}
```

# Characteristics of Records

1. **Immutability**: All fields in a Record are immutable. Once created, their values cannot be changed.
2. **Automatic Provision of Standard Methods**: Methods such as equals(), hashCode(), and toString() are automatically provided.
3. **Restricted Inheritance**: Records cannot extend other classes, nor can they be extended.

# Why Use Records?

1. **Conciseness**: Reduces boilerplate code when defining data-only classes like DTOs.
2. **Clear Intent**: Using Records clearly indicates that the class is meant for data only.
3. **Guaranteed Immutability**: Ensures data immutability, minimizing bugs and enhancing code stability.

# Conclusion

Java Records simplify the definition of data-only classes while ensuring code stability and clarity.

When defining objects that represent data and require reduced boilerplate code, consider using 'Record'.
